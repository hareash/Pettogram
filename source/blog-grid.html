						<p>

							Franchising is a dynamic business model that empowers entrepreneurs to own and operate a proven business under an established brand. In a franchise system, the franchisor provides support, training, and a successful blueprint, enabling franchisees to replicate the business with a higher chance of success. This symbiotic relationship benefits both parties, as franchisees benefit from an established brand and proven methods, while franchisors expand their brand presence and share in the success of individual outlets. Franchising fosters entrepreneurship, encourages local economic growth, and has become a globally recognized avenue for business expansion, offering a win-win proposition for aspiring business owners.</p>
